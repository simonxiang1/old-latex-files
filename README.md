##Insert Creative Title
Old LaTeX files, made primarily for the purpose of learning how to use LaTeX. Physics lab reports are complete memes, they ranked 5>7>4>6 in terms of seriousness. Please read them if you like dry mathematics humor. Each project has its own directory, the source code is in the .tex file and the output is simply \<name\>.pdf.
#####Additional Comments
Note: when I was making these LaTeX files my file management sense was absolute garbage so everything was in the same directory (hence the strange figure naming convention). Becoming organized online is a WIP.
