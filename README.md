## What's this?

Old LaTeX files, made primarily for the purpose of learning how to use LaTeX. I can only recommend you read physics lab report 6 (the others are not as entertaining). Please read it if you like dry mathematics humor. Each project has its own directory, the source code is in the .tex file and the output is simply \<name\>.pdf.

## Don't plagiarize

I don't condone plagiarism. If you're a TAMS/UNT kid who stumbled upon the physics lab reports and are looking to copy them for a free 100: don't! Moral issues aside, they most definitely will not compile in Word, and are filled with idiosyncratic speech anyway.
