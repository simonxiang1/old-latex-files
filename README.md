## What's this??

Old LaTeX files, made primarily for the purpose of learning how to use LaTeX. Physics lab reports are complete memes, they ranked 5>7>4>6 in terms of seriousness (with 6 being the least serious). Please read them if you like dry mathematics humor. Each project has its own directory, the source code is in the .tex file and the output is simply \<name\>.pdf.

## Don't plagiarize

I don't condone plagiarism! Not sure if these show up on a web search or not, but if you're a TAMS/UNT kid who stumbled upon the physics lab reports and are looking to copy them for a free 100: don't! I don't want to deal with any unintended consequences due to making my repo public. Half the stuff probably won't even work in Microsoft Word and the lab reports are filled with idiosyncratic speech anyway.

## This is garbage!!

◯正解! I pretty much learned LaTeX on the spot while making these, now I have the power to write nonsensical statements in LaTeX (which automatically implies that they're correct, since anything that's been TeXed is always true). I'm planning on writing a bunch of new notes on interesting topics (so, no physics) like Abstract Algebra/Algebraic Topology soon, once I finish my vim+LaTeX setup.

#### Additional Comments

When I was making these LaTeX files my file management sense was absolute garbage so everything was in the same directory, hence the strange figure naming convention. (Why is this README so long for something that's not even a program??)
