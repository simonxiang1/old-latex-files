% Example 1
\ldots when Einstein introduced his formula
\begin{equation}
e = m \cdot c^2 \; ,
\end{equation}
which is at the same time the most widely known
and the least well understood physical formula.
% Example 2
\ldots from which follows Kirchhoff's current law:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=1}^{n} I_k = 0 \; .
\end{equation}
Kirchhoff's voltage law can be derived \ldots
% Example 3
\ldots which has several advantages.
\begin{equation}
I_D = I_F - I_R
\end{equation}
is the core of a very different transistor model. \ldots

Can I try this?
